# `Minky`
A parantheses-less indent-based lisp. There is an example here [`example/example.mkx`](./example/example.mkx) to know how it looks like.

## Build from source
This is a pure rust project, so just:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RechieKho/minky
cd minky
cargo run -- example/example.mkx # Build and run the example
```

## TODO
- Big int and Big rational
- logical operators

... The list goes on ...
